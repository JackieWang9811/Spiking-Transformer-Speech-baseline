# Spiking-Transformer-Speech: A baseline code to reproduce the spiking transformer model for speech command recognition.

# Our final organized code for "Efficient Speech Command Recognition Leveraging Spiking Neural Networks and Progressive Time-scaled Curriculum Distillation" will be made publicly available in a common repository once the camera-ready version of the submission is finalized.
